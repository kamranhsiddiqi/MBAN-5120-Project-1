In exercise physiology, an objective measure of aerobic fitness is how efficiently the body can absorb and use oxygen (i.e. oxygen consumption). Subjects participated in a exercise run of 1.5 miles. Measurements of the club membersâ€™ oxygen consumption as well as several other continuous measurements such as age, pulse, and weight were recorded. The researchers were interested in determining which variables can help predict oxygen consumption. The data set is called fitness.msas7bdat
